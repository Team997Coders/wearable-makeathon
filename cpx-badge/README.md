# Circuit Playground IR Button

In this project we are going to create a IR reactive button with the Circuit Playground Express (CPX)!  This project
is much better when you do it with a friend :-).

## Instructions:

1. Install the code editor following the instructions [here](README.md).
2. Download the code repository [here](https://github.com/Team997Coders/wearable-workshop)
    1. Click on *code* on the top right of the screen and select *Download ZIP*.
    2. Navigate to your downloads folder and extract the ZIP file.
    3. Navigate to the newly created folder and find cpx-badge/src/code.py file.
    4. Make sure your battery is charged.
3. Download code to the CPX
    1. Plug in the CPX using the USB cable into your computer. This should show up as a USB flashdrive.
    2. Navigate to the USB flashdrive file folder.
    3. Copy the cpx-badge/src/code.py file onto the flashdrive. You will need to overwrite the previous code.py.
    4. The cpx should restart after a few seconds running the new code.py!
    5. Test your code by pressing the buttons while having the cpx pointed at someone elese with another cpx-badge. 
4. Install the battery and case
    1. Get out the battery and the case from your kit.  
    2. Get a button to mount your cpx onto and some double sided tape to attach it.
    3. With the button facing up on a flat surface with the pin back aligned towards the top.
    4. Using two small pieces of tape, attach the case with the small openings toward the top/bottom edge and the tabs
          on the sides.
    5. Put the battery in the center of the case with the wire leading out the opening in the bottom edge of the case.
    6. Snap the CPX into the case with the black battery connector at the bottom.
### Operation:
Wear your badge and when you see someone wearning another one, press one of your buttons (be careful and don't cover up
the IR leds when you press the button, it is best to try to press them from the side).

There are two modes depending on which button you press:
Button 'A' will cause a Rainbow patttern.
Button 'B' will cause a Flashing Pattern.

Enjoy!
