Code for the 2023 CHS wearable workshop. This Readme has the basic instruction for installing


# Getting Started
The circuit playground express and Gemma are neat little programmable boards from Adafruit. It is particularly designed to make it easy to design, make, and program wearable electronic projects. We are planning on using the CircuitPython environment to program these boards. For more information on documentation for using the Circuit Playground Express check out this Adafruit link: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express

## Download and Install CircuitPython (This step has already been done for you)
Follow these instructions to install circuit python onto your Circuit Playground Express https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/circuitpython-quickstart

If you are running Windows 7 or older, you may need to follow the instructions:

## Install an Editor
We need to be able to edit code on the Circuit Playground Express, which needs a code editor. Skip to the relevant documentation for a Windows/Mac/Linux machine versus a Chromebook
**For expert users**: Feel free to use your favorite editor, but it wonâ€™t have built-in support for getting debug statements.

### Installing the Editor on Chromebooks
We will need to install two programs to run the editor on chromebooks. 
Caret Editor extension for Chrome https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/caret/fljalecfjciodhpcledpamjachpmelml?hl=en
Beagle Term https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/beagle-term/gkdofhllgfohlddimiiildbgoggdpoea?hl=en

The first allows us to edit files on the chromebook, the second lets us connect and see print statements.

### Installing the Editor on Mac/Windows/Linux (Skip unless you are using Mac/Windows/Linux)
Checkout adafruit's documentation directly https://learn.adafruit.com/using-circuit-playground-express-makecode-circuitpython-on-a-chromebook/using-circuitpython



## Plugging in the circuit playground express / Gemma
Use the USB cable to plug the device into your computer. The playground express / Gemma will show up as a USB drive to your computer. To find it **TODO** I don't actually know how to get to files on the chromebook.



# CircuitPython

CircuitPython is a slightly modified lightweight version of the python programming langauge for small electronics. For all sorts of more information about CircuitPython checkout this link [CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython).
