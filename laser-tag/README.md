# Circuit Playground (CPX) Laser Tag Game

In this project we are going to create a a pair of CPX buttons that allow
you and a friend to play laser-tag!

This code uses the 'makecode' editor.  But don't worry it runs on the web too.

## Instructions:

1. Download the code repository [here](https://github.com/Team997Coders/wearable-workshop)
    1. Click on *code* on the top right of the screen and select *Download ZIP*.
    2. Navigate to your downloads folder and extract the ZIP file.
    3. Navigate to the newly created folder and find laser-tag folder
    4. Make sure your battery is charged.
3. Download code to the CPX
    1. Plug in the CPX using the USB cable into your computer. This should show up as a USB flashdrive.
    2. Press the reset button on the CPX.  The LEDs should turn green.  If not then press the reset button again.
    3. Drag the circuitplayground-laser_tag.uf2 file onto the flashdrive.
    4. The cpx should restart after a few seconds running the new code.py!
    5. Test your code by pressing the buttons while having the cpx pointed at someone elese with another laser-tag badge. 
4. Install the battery and case
    1. Get out the battery and the case from your kit.  
    2. Get a button to mount your cpx onto and some double sided tape to attach it.
    3. With the button facing up on a flat surface with the pin back aligned towards the top.
    4. Using two small pieces of tape, attach the case with the small openings toward the top/bottom edge and the tabs
          on the sides.
    5. Put the battery in the center of the case with the wire leading out the opening in the bottom edge of the case.
    6. Snap the CPX into the case with the black battery connector at the bottom.
### Operation:
Have two people wearing these badges.  Press the 'A' or 'B' buttons and the number of 'hits' should be shown on the LEDs.

When you have used up all your hits, then a little tune will plan and the game is over.
You will need to press the reset button to start a new game.

Enjoy!
